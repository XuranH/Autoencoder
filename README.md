## Introduction
There exists many ways to detect anomaly, One-class SVMs, Elliptic Envelopes... These methods belong to the field of machine learning, however there are also many models for anomaly detection in deep learning area. Autoencoders, a type of unsupervised neural network, are exactly one of the models. In the following sections, we will apply three different autoencoders which are simple autoencoder, deep fully-connected autoencoder and variational autoencoder, to detect the outliers in the datasets that we built based on MNIST data and fashionMNIST data and compare their results.

## How to detect the outliers by using autoencoder
## Data discription (MNIST)
How we build our train set and test set
## Three methods applied and their performances
## Applied on another dataset (FashionMNIST)
## Strengths and Weaknesses
size of train set?
